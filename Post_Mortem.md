What do we think we did well?
	* we did a good job of planning and assigning tasks
	* we did a good job of doing the tasks on time at the beginning
	* work done for tasks was complete and appropriate--ended up getting us good grades


What do we think we did poorly?
	* we didn't have a good daily check in process
	* we didn't communicate well about deadlines and responsibilities
	* should have been meeting regularly to discuss upcoming work and deadlines
		* even if it was just for a few minutes after class
	* without regular meetings, there was no way for us to reliably communicate
	* consequences of lack of communication:
		* loss of productivity
		* not getting work done by deadlines
		* added stress of worry about communication
		* difficulty scheduling

Thoughts on the final proposal:
	* pretty easy to put together because we already had all of the information

Thoughts on the overall project as an educational experience:
	* learned a lot about how to create and organize requirements
	* also learned a lot about what it takes to run things smoothly
		* our communication issues demonstrated how easy it is for projects and deadlines to slide
	* took a hard path with eliciation versus what was necessary to fulfill the requirements
		* the nature of our project was very technologically intense, so we had to find people outside of our general spheres
		* didn't realize how much more we were taking on than we needed to when we were planning

Primary mitigation effort in the future:
	* brief check in after every class to discuss what we've done, what deadlines are coming up, and what we each need to do to fulfill those deadlines
